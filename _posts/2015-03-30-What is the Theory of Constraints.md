Introduction
------------
I'm obviously a big fan of the Agile methods and Lean/Kanban, as
evidenced by how the teams on which I work, consult, or participate
use aspects of each for their chosen processes. One of the underlying
philosophies of both Agile and Lean/Kanban is the
Theory of Constraints (ToC). The Theory of Constraints was developed
by Eliyahu Goldratt in the early 1980s to describe how workflows
can be understood and improved by focusing on the bottlenecks that
constrain the flow of value through the system being measured.


Goldratt explained his reasoning in three novels, *The Goal*,
*Critical Chain*, and *It's Not Luck*. In each of these, different
aspects of the ToC are described through mildly entertaining
characters and story lines. The first book, *The Goal*, describes the
ToC itself and the Process of Ongoing Improvements (POOGI). *Critical
Chain* talks about Critical Chain Management, a style of thinking that
takes the concept of a critical path for a project and expands it to support
multiple projects. And finally, *It's Not Luck* introduces Goldratt's
Thinking Processes, which are orderly patterns of thinking that help
you understand the current situation, define the intended future state, and
chart a path from to that future. All great reads, highly recommended.

The Theory of Constraints
-------------------------
His most important point, however, is the ToC and advice about how to
apply it. In a nutshell, the ToC boils down to understanding how value flows through your production system, learning where the bottlenecks are, and iterating over improving the efficiency and effectiveness of processing at the bottlenecks. He gives the outline of a process to follow in this improvement, called the 5 Focusing Steps:

1. Identify the constraint in your system,
2. Exploit the constraint by making sure that this particular part of your workflow is busy and productive all the time,
3. Subordinate everything to the constraint by reducing production eveywhere  else in your system to avoid having work pile up, waiting to be processed,
4. Elevate the constraint by improving its ability to process the value by adding capacity, changing the nature of the work, hiring, and so on,
5. Return to the first step to find the new constraint in the system.

This process never stops, as there is always exactly one bottleneck in
a system, and you can always discuss ways to eliminate it.

In *The Goal*, Goldratt writes a pretty approachable example of the Theory of
Constraints in practice when he describes a Boy Scout march the
protagonist, Alex, leads with his son. His job is to take the whole
troop on a trip through the woods to a camping site before
nightfall. The boys start marching through the woods, and for various
reasons they aren't making the kind of progress that he hoped for. One
boy in particular, Herbie, is moving a lot more slowly than the rest,
and he is both slowing down everyone behind him and allowing everyone
in front of him to spread out so far that they can't keep track of
each other.

Through some careful thinking, Alex understands that Herbie is the
limiting factor, or constraint, in how fast the team can march. So he exploits how
fast Herbie can march by putting him at the front of the line of boys,
so that he can always keep moving, and and subordinates the progress
of every other boy by telling each to keep a 10
foot margin behind the boy in front. Now everyone is marching at the
same rate, and the length of the column is fixed for the most
part. Since the speed is now constrained by how fast Herbie can march,
he elevates that speed by offloading the junk in Herbie's pack to the
other boys, which lets Herbie and the whole troop march faster. They
arrive at their destination, all are happy, and Alex learns a valuable
lesson he can take back to work the next day.

It's a better story in the book, but you get the idea. The ToC is
actually a pretty simple theory, but it has amazing applicability to
so many situations. Read the books and judge for yourself.

Why Should You Care?
--------------------
The whole reason why I'm writing about this is that I believe the
Theory of Constraints can be used to explain and justify the processes
and practices that are part of the individual Agile methods. In future
blog posts, I want to take a typical team and talk about how you can
optimize the progress made by that team through applying the ToC to
the constraints of that team.

I plan on writing posts about the importance of good and important
stories, the criticality of acceptance tests to avoiding unnecessary
work, and then discuss the Extreme Programming engineering practices
of Pair Programming, Refactoring, Test Driven Development, and
Continuous Integration/Deployment.

Thanks for reading this far, and I'm looking forward to writing the
rest of this series over time.
