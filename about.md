Hi, I'm Brian Button. I am currently the Program Manager and Engineering Manager for Cloud Storage for CenturyLink. I live and work in St. Louis.

I've been working for CenturyLink since the beginning of 2014. During my time here, I was the leader of the IronFoundry project for about 6 months, then I moved over to the newly formed Storage team. I currently lead two teams building out different types of cloud storage for us. These are very interesting, technically challenging projects, and I'm enjoying working on them very much. I have two great teams, and we're building products that will let anyone store anything they want into our cloud.

The *eventually consistent* thread running through the blog is a play on the subject of cloud storage. In the cloud world, and especially object storage, you generally keep multiple copies of data in different, geographically separate data centers to increase the availability for that data. Several local copies of data are created at the moment that users store their data into object storage, but the replication of that data to another data center happens as quickly as possible. This means that data that gets written on your behalf into the two locations may be inconsistent for some short time, but it will be... get ready for it... eventually consistent!

Prior to working for CenturyLink, I have been an Agile/XP coach/mentor/trainer/leader since around 2000. My passion is for the technical practices inherent in Extreme Programming, since developing has been in my blood since before college even, but I also love helping people and teams learn how the softer skills of XP and other Agile methods help people succeed. And going back even further, I was a hard-code developer from 1987 to 2000, building lots of interesting and complex systems in the scientific, oil and gas, and firmware worlds.
